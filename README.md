# FileManager
Simple program to manage files in large quantities, and this includes deleting and renaming.
### Some features are W.I.P
Features like copy to clipboard or delete duplicates are W.I.P and currently don't work.
### How to use
1. Click the "open folder" button to selected a folder.
2. There are many options for you to choose rename, delete, open and open file locaiton.
3. There are three options on the side for larger actions rename all, delete duplicateds and delete all.
### Long loads
Some folders with alot of files may take longer to load as they contain alot of file for the program to read. This could also have to do with your system and how it indexes files.
### Clean and easy to use UI
